<h2><b>⚠️Error Messages</b></h2>
<h4><b>MCT Tool is a multi purpose tool, it comes with various useful features, but you may tackle some Error codes which are their to prevent wrong configurations or progress loss! Below are common Error codes which you may tackle or tackled in Tool:</b></h4>
<h4><b>1.Google Drive Error: Google Account is not connected!</b></h4>
<p><b>This Error code is self explanatory and caused when you try to use MCT Tool without connecting your Google Account. The main aim of MCT Tool is to save/edit/export important configurations from/to your Google Drive, this is because Colab provides temporary runtimes which got reset due to inactivity.</b></p>
<h4><b>2.Restore point not exist in your Google Drive, use additional feature of MCT Tool and it will be automatically created.</b></h4>
<p><b>As usual, this error code is also self explanatory and caused only when you try to fetch your previously saved MCT Tool configurations from My Drive. MCT Tool creates and saves all your important input or simply values of specific variables in "MCT-Config" folder located in your My Drive and that's why it checks before fetching any configurations or simply values that if the "MCT-Config" folder exist or not. Basically this check is their to save your time and make MCT Tool work faster because it will take time to check the existance of 4-5 files at place of checking the existance of only folder and only importing configurations only if they exist.</b></p>
<h4><b>3.MEGA Credentials not found or not valid!</b></h4>
<p><b>This Error happens when you ask program to download MEGA Links using MEGA Account, but you not provided the MEGA Account credentials or wrong credentials.</b></p>
<h4><b>4.Path Error: One or more required path is missing! Check if you connected Google Account or not?</b></h4>
<p><b>When you don't provide required paths like Source path or Destination path then this problem happens. This can also be happen if Google Account is not connected but this condition is already no more exist after v4.0.2 of MCT Tool.</b></p>
<h4><b>5.Destination field is empty, hence downloaded files will be moved to downloads folder.</b></h4>
<p><b>If you leave Destination field empty while downloading files from MEGA Links then it will trigger this error. In that case your MEGA Link will be downloaded in "downloads" folder of runtime allotted to you by Google Colab. Basically I was tired of using sys.exit() so I ignored this error and tried to warn user at place of interuptting whole work.🤣</b></p>
<h4><b>6.Source field can't be empty.</b></h4>
<p><b>Uff...🤣 Read Error again! and reason that why I added this error is written in error 5 (Destination Error).</b></p>
<h4><b>7.Input Error: Invalid input parameter! Please enter 0 or 1 as input.</b></h4>
<p><b>MCT Tool requires user's favor before doing  particular task and hence it follows a simple format where '0' (Zero) means No and '1'(One) means Yes and entering something else trigger this error.</b></p>
<h2><b>🚅Modes of Transfer</b></h2>
<h4><b>As this project use Rclone as a base! and Rclone support multiple options to help you move or clean your Data, in this Project those options are known as Modes. Here is the list of the Modes that this Project supports:</b></h4>
    <h4><b><code>Copy</code>: Copy files from source to dest, skipping identical files.</b></h4>
    <h4><b><code>Copyto</code>: This can be used to upload single files to other than their current name.</b></h4>
    <h4><b><code>CopyURL</code>: Download a URL's content and copy it to the destination without saving it in temporary storage.</b></h4>
    <h4><b><code>Move</code>: Moves the contents of the source directory to the destination directory.</b></h4>
    <h4><b><code>Moveto</code>: If source:path is a file or directory then it moves it to a file or directory named dest:path.</b></h4>
    <h4><b><code>Check</code>: Checks the files in the source and destination match. It compares sizes and hashes (MD5 or SHA1) and logs a report of files that don't match. It doesn't alter the source or destination.</b></h4>
    <h4><b><code>Sync</code>: Sync the source to the destination, changing the destination only. Doesn't transfer files that are identical on source and destination, testing by size and modification time or MD5SUM. Destination is updated to match source, including deleting files if necessary (except duplicate objects, see below).</b></h4>
    <h4><b><code>Bisync</code>: Bisync provides a bidirectional cloud sync solution in rclone. It retains the Path1 and Path2 filesystem listings from the prior run. On each successive run it will:</b></h4>
    <h4><b><code>Cat</code>: Rclone cat sends any files to standard output.</b></h4>
    <h4><b><code>CleanUp</code>: Clean up the remote if possible. Empty the trash or delete old file versions. Not supported by all remotes.</b></h4>
    <h4><b><code>ls</code>: List all the objects in the path with size and path.</b></h4>
    <h4><b><code>lsd</code>: List all directories/containers/buckets in the path.</b></h4>
    <h4><b><code>lsl</code>: List all the objects in the path with size, modification time and path.</b></h4>
    <h4><b><code>test makefile</code>: Make files with random contents and of any size.</b></h4>
    <h4><b><code>md5sum</code>: Produce an md5sum file for all the objects in the path.</b></h4>
    <h4><b><code>sha1sum</code>: Produce a sha1sum file for all the objects in the path.</b></h4>
    <h4><b><code>size</code>: Return the total size and number of objects in path.</b></h4>
    <h4><b><code>genautocomplete</code>: Output shell completion scripts for rclone.</b></h4>
    <h4><b><code>gendocs</code>: Output markdown docs for rclone to the directory supplied.</b></h4>
    <h4><b><code>obscure</code>: Obscure password for use in the rclone.conf.</b></h4>
    <h4><b><code>tree</code>: List the contents of the remote in a tree like fashion.</b></h4>
  <p><b>Following Modes can easily cause Data Loss:</b></p>
    <h4><b><code>Delete</code>: Remove the files in path.</b></h4>
    <h4><b><code>Purge</code>: Will delete whole Directory and leaving nothing behind.</b></h4>
    <h4><b><code>rmdir</code>: Completely Delete the given path.</b></h4>
    <h4><b><code>rmdirs</code>: Remove any empty directories under the path.</b></h4>
<h2><b>🎯Points to be Remembered</b></h2>
    <h4><b>1.Always choose No <code>n</code> for Auto-Config because we are not going to use Rclone on our Local Device/Machine otherwise login will not work!</b></h4>
    <h4><b>2.Don't forget to type <code>!</code> before executing any custom Rclone Command.</b></h4>
<h4><b>3.For Safety! Rclone will always save progress in your My Drive! Not in any of your Shared Drive.</b></h4>
    <h4><b>4.Use the <code>Dry Run</code> option to check both Source and Destination path without copying anything.</b></h4>
<h4><b>5.You can either choose the path of Cloud Account folder or any other folder inside it.</b></h4>
<h2><b>🗃️Supported Command List</b></h2>
<h4><b><a href="https://github.com/TheCaduceus/Multi-Cloud-Transfer-Tool/blob/main/cmds.md">Show List</a></b></h4>
<h2><b>🤔Why use this?</b></h4>
<h4><b>1.Simple UI: Rclone is really a very powerful command line tool! but some users are really not comfortable with Command line and hence it become difficult to use this type of useful tools, so this Project provides a very interactive User Interface (UI) to operate it with less inputs.</b></h4>
<h4><b>2.Rclone creates "rclone.conf" file, which is the most important thing to make rclone useful. But when you change your device, then you have to create a new rclone.conf file. But this Project saves your rclone.conf file to Google Drive and you can use the same file repeatedly, what you just need is your Google Account and nothing.</b></h4>
<h4><b>3.Heavy flexibility: You can use this project anytime & anywhere because it is totally cloud based, that means if you are moving files in your PC and want to check its progress in your phone then you just have to login on Google Collab in your Phone.</b></h4>
<h4><b>4.Variety of features: It comes with various amazing Add-ons which will make your task or work simpler. It combines the power of Rclone with other engines which make a combination that can do your work by taking less efforts and giving more output.</b></h4>
